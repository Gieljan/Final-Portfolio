-My struggle
-Research Project
My MA thesis Research is about Video games and control society (I chose the videogame Watch_Dog because of its unqiue theme of hacking). In the analysis of Watch_Dogs many of the formal properties of the games (such as exactly where you can go, how fast you walk,but pretty much anything) is programmed. The programmers of the game are the only people in control, while the players (whilst they are promised they will be able to hack) are severalely limited by the programmers.
To understand what is a good game you also need to understand what is a bad game. I have therefore tried to break a game, so the game is playable, but just terrible.
