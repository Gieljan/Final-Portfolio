Future Session – 

No actual coding in class but a quick breakdown of simple programs – have a look clasically on how they look. A look at games a look at website, what does what?


Theory about code, discussion about the theory and how it realtes back to coding – something that is mentioned as program.


Think about how you should go about coding this> what do you need to specify
In groups in class come up with a plan to discuss whcih steps need to be taken and what code is necisary fort this – Where do you start and why?
