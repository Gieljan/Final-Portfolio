        <h2>MY STRUGGLES & PERFECT FUTURE SESSION</h2>
  		  <p>I have trouble building javascript programs from scratch. Whenever I look at a script it makes sense to me completely but I find it very hard to come up with the correct code for what I am trying to do. I have a very specific learning style since I have a learning disability which prevents me from fully focusing at times. For me it is going to be a steeper learning curve perhaps since I do tend to make a lot of errors while coding. Going through code in class is not particularly helpful for me, and I just require a lot of practice. My perfect session involves looking at particular objects in javascript and then figuring out what building blocks are used for that particular program. Eventually I would like to build a game since game studies is my area of (relative) expertise and it would be great to be able to build some of the basic code to understand the workings of the works I analyse.</p>
      
        <h2>Link to my research</h2>
        <p>My MA thesis Research is about Video games and control society. As a case study I chose the videogame Watch_Dog because of its unqiue theme of hacking. In the analysis of Watch_Dogs many of the formal properties of the games (such as exactly where you can go, how fast you walk) is programmed. Watch_Dogs promises players a form of control, while really they are just interacting with the variables the programmers have created (and in the case of my Case Study, these options are very limited, and the concept of hacking is fetished). The programmers of the game are the only people in control, while the players (whilst they are promised they will be able to hack) are not. The study of 'bad games' can teach us a lot oabout came design because they make their formal traits evident by botching them. Understam what exactly is a bad game is thus important when I eventually make my brilliant game. For this checkpoint in this course I have therefore morphed one of the most recognisable video games ever to be created. The game is fully playable, but by transforming the formal qualities of the core gameplay, it gives an insight into those formal traits. </p>
