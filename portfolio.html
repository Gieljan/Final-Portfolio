        <h2>MY STRUGGLES & PERFECT FUTURE SESSION</h2>
  		  <p>I have trouble building JavaScript programs from scratch. Whenever I look at a script it makes sense to me completely but I find it very hard to come up with the correct code for the task at hand. I have a very specific learning style since I have a learning disability, which prevents me from fully focusing at times. For me it is going to be a steeper learning curve perhaps since I do tend to make a lot of errors while coding (and I look over errors quite easily). Going through code in class is not particularly helpful for me as I cannot focus on the specifics. For me coding is something that requires a lot of practice on my own (the courses and games involving coding are the most helpful for me). My perfect session involves looking at particular objects in JavaScript and then figuring out what building blocks are used for that particular program (so to not go very deep into the code itself, but what kind of code used, and where to start). Eventually I would like to build a game (with actual graphics) since game studies is my area of (relative) expertise and it would be great to be able to build some of the basic code to understand the workings of the works I analyse.</p>
      
        <h2>Link to my research</h2>
        <p>My MA thesis Research is about video games in Deleuze’s informatics control society. As a case study I chose the videogame Watch_Dog because of its unique theme of hacking. In the analysis of Watch_Dogs it struck me how often my observations came from very formal properties of the game. Where can I walk? Why not there? How fast do I move? Where do I move? These are all decisions that are not necessarily part of the embedded narrative of the game but are at the direct control of the programmer. Watch_Dogs promises players a form of control, while really they are just interacting with the variables the programmers have created. In the case of my Case Study, these options are very limited, and the concept of hacking is fetishized The programmers of the game are the only people who control the means of control, while the players (whilst they are promised they will be able to hack) are interacting with these variables. The study of 'bad’ video games are important within game analysis as they can teach us a lot about came design because they make their formal traits evident by botching them. Understanding what exactly is a bad game and why it is a bad game are important for me to eventually create a brilliant game. For this checkpoint in this course I have therefore morphed one of the most recognisable video games ever to be created. The challenge for me was to leave the game to be fully playable. By transforming the formal qualities in the code of the core gameplay, it exposed those formal traits to me and will ultimately help me be a better coder and a better analyst.</p>
