        <h2>MY STRUGGLES & PERFECT FUTURE SESSION</h2>
  		  <p>I have trouble building javascript programs from scratch. Whenever I look at a script it makes sense to me completely but I find it very hard to come up with the correct code for what I am trying to do. I have a very specific learning style sinceI have a learning disability which prevents me from fully focusing at times. For me it is going to be a steeper learning curve perhaps since I do tend to make a lot of errors while coding. Going through code in class is not particularly helpful for me, and I just require a lot of practice. My perfect session involves looking at particular objects in javascript and then figuring out what building blocks are used for that particular program. Eventually I would like to build a game since game studies is my area of (relative) expertise.</p>
      
        <h2>Link to my research</h2>
        <p>My MA thesis Research is about Video games and control society (I chose the videogame Watch_Dog because of its unqiue theme of hacking). In the analysis of Watch_Dogs many of the formal properties of the games (such as exactly where you can go, how fast you walk,but pretty much anything) is programmed. This is decided by programming. The programmers of the game are the only people in control, while the players (whilst they are promised they will be able to hack) are severalely limited by the programmers. To understand what is a good game you also need to understand what is a bad game (quote). I have therefore tried to break a game, so the game is playable, but just terrible.</p>
